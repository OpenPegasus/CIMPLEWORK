Usage: %s [OPTIONS] [LIBRARY_NAME] [SOURCE_FILE ...] | [SOURCE_CLASS ...]

This utility generates a makefile for building a provider module.

   LIBRARY_NAME  - the name of the library module that will be generated.
   SOURCES_FILE  - parameter defines a source file that will be compiled
                   into this provider module. Repeat for each source file
   SOURCE_CLASS  - class that will be compiled into a provider in this
                   provider module. (Experimental)

Examples:
    genmak president president vicepresident # create with module name
                                             # president and classes president
                                             # and vicepresident

    genmak -flrg president president.cpp \         # create with defined files
           president_Provider.cpp vicepresident.cpp \ # overwrite add regmod
           vicepresident.cpp module.cpp \          # livetest & gen targets
           repository.cpp

The SOURCE_CLASS parameter defines a list of classes for this provider. genmak
automatically added the repository.cpp and module.cpp files to the list.
(Experimental)
 
The alternative SOURCE_FILE parameter requires a list of all the .cpp files
that will be compiled as part of the provider.

The first name on the list determines if it is a list of classes (i.e. no
suffix on the name) or a file list.
  
If SOURCE_FILE is used this utility assumes that genclass, genprov, and 
genmod have been previously executed to generate the various files for the 
provider.  It will stop for any .ccp file on the input line that does not 
exist.  

OPTIONS:
    -V      -- print the version.
    -h      -- print this message.
    -f      -- overwrite the Makefile if it already exists. Creates backup
               file Makefile.bak
    -C      -- generate a CMPI provider module (rather than Pegasus C++).
    -g      -- generate targets for all operations (genclass, genprov, genmod)
               Works only if class list provided rather than file list. This
               allows future regeneration of the files to be controlled through
               Makefile (i.e. make genclass, make genprov, make genmod,
               etc. (Experimental)
    -r      -- generate regmod target. (Experimental) and only for OpenPegasus
    -l      -- generate sample client calls from command line (Experimental)
    -v      -- verbose display of execution
