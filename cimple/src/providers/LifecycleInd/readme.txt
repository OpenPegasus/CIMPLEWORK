This provider implements a single class that can create,
modify, and delete instances, a set of classes for
lifecycle indications and the linkage so that if the
indications are enabled, the execution of create, modify,
or delete on the target class causes a corresponding
lifecycle indication to be generated.

It is very simplistic, designed simply to demonstrate the
mechanism to pass information for lifecycle indications from
a class provider to a corresponding instance creation, etc.
